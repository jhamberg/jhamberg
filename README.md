## `Hello world!`

I'm a Computer Scientist, Developer and a MSc student at the University of Helsinki, Finland. My research interests include **Crowdsensing**, **Internet of Things** and **Big Data Architectures**.

I work in the [NODES group](https://www.cs.helsinki.fi/en/nodes) at the Department of Computer Science, University of Helsinki, where I participate in various projects such as [MegaSense](https://www.helsinki.fi/en/researchgroups/sensing-and-analytics-of-air-quality/about-megasense), [Carat](http://carat.cs.helsinki.fi/), and [UbiSpark](https://ubispark.cs.helsinki.fi/). I also have been involved in a collaboration with the RIB-consortium and partaken in research related to mobile thermal imaging.
